# Brain-Twister

The second-year Computer Systems Engineering degree module of Object-Oriented Programming was heavily dependent on coursework, which involved developing a fully-functioning program in Java. Samuel decided to create a game, named “Brain Twister”, where the player is expected to collect points by touching defined falling coloured words with his avatar that is moved with the mouse. Game lives are lost if the player touches the wrong words (e.g. if the requested colour - top left corner of the screen - is yellow and the player touches a green word that is not the “yellow” word) and the game speed increases as the player accumulates points. Full instructions are available in game menu.

The external library JavaFX was used to accomplish a superior graphic visual compared to Swing, and to utilise JavaFX’s built-in animation class. The program included a sophisticated logic structure, appropriate exceptions, and well designed, encapsulated and scoped classes. By creating the game, Samuel engaged with lecturers and applied information from various sources, learning how to use Java as a programming language as well as data types and operators, control statements, classes, objects, methods, constructors, interface, inheritance, encapsulation and exceptions.

“Brain Twister” received the highest mark among the class and was highly praised by the lecturer, who marked the JavaDoc at 85% and the following categories at 90%: performance, functionality, design, clarity of code, suitability of classes and justification of classes.

The project was a fantastic experience as the envisaged product was successfully delivered through dedication and continuous learning. A demonstration of the game can be seen on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d14WCFC0vY8&t=2s

Further details:
* instructions file can be editable. The instruction number must be followed by the instruction and separated by one tab "\t"
* scores file cannot be manipulated as the information is in binary code to avoid cheating
* The game is not designed to provide a victory message because it was designed to be practically impossible to run out of attempts
